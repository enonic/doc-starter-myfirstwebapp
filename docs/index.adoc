A step-by-step tutorial for building your first web application with Enonic XP

WARNING: This documentation is currently under construction, do not use!

== Introduction

This guide will take you through the basic steps of creating a web app, using the basic building blocks of Enonic XP.

During this exercise you will:

* learn about http controllers
* serve assets
* use of templates
* error pages
* trying out the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/router-lib[router library]
* and more...

== Create project

To set up the development environment and initialize the project, follow the instructions in the https://developer.enonic.com/start[Getting started guide].

NOTE: *In step 2:* Choose "*My First Web app*" starter, and create a *new sandbox* for the project

====
After deploying, you should find an entry similar to this in the sandbox log:

  2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [<my.project.name>] installed successfully
====

Your XP instance (aka sandbox) should now be running on http://localhost:8080

== Project structure

The project folder created should now contain a project structure, looking something like this:

[source,files]
----
build.gradle <--1-->
settings.gradle
build/ <--2-->
src/
  main/
    java/ <!--3-->
    resources/ <!--4-->
      assets/ <!--5-->
      webapp/ <!--6-->
----

<1> The gradle files are used by the build system
<2> Contains output files produced by the build
<3> Optional folder for Java code (used to import sample site in this starter)
<4> Main location for XP specific project code
<5> Static assets such as css and icons are placed here
<6> Folder containing the root webapp http controller


== Webapp

To see your current application:

. log in to the XP admin console (http://localhost:8080)
. open the "Applications" app, and select the listed applications
. visit the app by clicking the web app link.

== JS Controller

Our current web app is quite simple.
To understand how it is build, take a look at the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/framework[http controller] placed in your project:

  /src/main/resources/webapp/webapp.js

The controller is automatically executed when your web app is being accessed.

Webapp.js is also referencing two asset files. These files can be found in the `/src/main/resources/assets/` folder.

[NOTE]
====
The web app engine automatically serves files placed in the `asset/` as if they were located in the root of your web app.
====

== Using Views

According to the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern,
we should separate the View (template) from the controller.
Enonic XP supports many different templating engines.
In this step, we'll use https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/thymeleaf-lib[Thymeleaf]:

. To make sure Thymeleaf is available for our project, we must update the `gradle.build` file.
Uncomment the following line from the "dependencies" section:
+
      include "com.enonic.lib:lib-thymeleaf:2.0.0-RC1"
+
. Create a new file `hello.html` and add it to the `webapp/` folder
+
.src/main/resources/webapp/hello.html
[source,html]
----
include::../code-samples/webapp-template/hello.html[]
----
+
. Then update your controller file to use the new template:
+
.src/main/resources/webapp/webapp.js
[source,js]
----
include::../code-samples/webapp-template/webapp.js[]
----
+
. When finished, redeploy the app. NB! Just start a new shell if your current shell is running the sandbox:
+
  enonic project deploy
+

Refresh your app, and you should see the heading "*Sweet... Views are working too!*".

[TIP]
====
A cool feature related to Thymeleaf templates is that they are actually pure HTML.
Meaning they may be opened directly in your browser.
Try opening the hello.html file to see for yourself:

== Asset serving

The current approach of asset serving is simple, but has several pitfalls.
Luckily, XP provides a better solution for serving assets:

* Asset url are created automatically (no need to deal with relative paths)
* Assets get 1 year cache headers (used by proxies and browsers)
* Every time you deploy a new app, new url's are generated (no more stale assets)

To use this functionality, we simply need a new template file:

. Update your `hello.html` template with the following content:
+
.src/main/resources/webapp/hello.html
[source,js]
----
include::../code-samples/webapp-template/hello-assets.html[]
----
+
. Redeploy once more:
+
  enonic project deploy
+

TIP: Try looking at the "Network" tab in your browsers developer tools to see the url and cache headers

== Routing

Routing is a common requirement for web applications.
In this step we will create a basic server-side router for handling different URLs.
In addition to the start page, we will create two more pages, and support navigation between them.


== Config management

TODO

Our app is using the Google Maps API.
Heavy usage of Googles services requires a valid API key.

Hardcoding an API key into your app is far from ideal.
Luckily, XP provides a simple way to inject configuration, like the API key, without having to change your app.

. Start by https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key[getting yourself a Google API key]
. Create a file called <name.of.your.app>.cfg i.e. "my.first.site.cfg" with the following content:
+
  maps.apiKey = <your google api key>
+
. Copy this file into your sandbox' config folder. The sandbox is located in your users home folder at .enonic/sandboxes/<name-of-sandbox>/home/config/
. After placing the file in the sandbox, you should now see a line from the sandbox log showing something like this:
+
  2019-05-05 20:07:39,462 INFO  c.e.x.s.i.config.ConfigInstallerImpl - Loaded config for [<name.of.your.app>]
+

To verify that the configuration is in use,
check the source code for a country page to see the following:
+
  <script src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=yourGoogleKey>"></script></head>
+


== Nice to know

=== Setting up vhosts

If you want to go live on a production server, you will need to configure a vhost.
Vhosts map the internal XP URI to a public facing URL i.e. mydomain.com -> /site/default/master/hello-world.

Read more about https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config#vhost[vhost configuration] in the XP docs.

=== Adding more apps

A site can be created from a single app, but you may also add more.
SEO Meta Fields, Disqus comments and Google Analytics are just a few of the many apps that can instantly add new features to your site.

To add an app, install an app from the "Applications" tool in the main menu.
Once installed, edit your site and add the application in the apps field.

=== Logging

While developing an app, it can be helpful to see the structure of objects returned by library functions.
A way to do this is by creating up a small utility script.

.src/main/resources/lib/utilities.js
[source,js]
----
exports.log = function (data) {
  log.info('Utilities log %s', JSON.stringify(data, null, 4));
};
----

Next, call the log function in any controller like the example below and then check the log after refreshing the page.

    var util = require('utilities');

    var content = portal.getContent();
    util.log(content);

This function and many more are included in the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/util-lib[Util Library]
